# Loan-Default-Prevention
Many companies, including banks and government loan services, use financial loan services to make sure people pay back their loans on time. They use machine learning models to find out who is most likely to not pay back their loans. This helps them take the right steps to help those people and reduce the number of people who don't pay back their loans.
This machine learning model helps predict loan defaults by analysing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and factors that indicate whether someone is likely to default on their loan.
